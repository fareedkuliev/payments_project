# payments_project
It's a test project. It's similar to the study-project where I was a developer during last 3 month. 
Here I've implemented JWT-auth, Docker containers, Swagger API. This app is RESTfull. 
There are several endpoints in the project that process GET an POST requests.
Also I've created several tables in MySQL DB where data has stored. 
The controllers provide payments between accounts - they cahrge off 'money', transmit them to another account in the 'bank'.
